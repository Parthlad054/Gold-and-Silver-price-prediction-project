# Gold-and-Silver-price-prediction-project

üî∞ **Project Title:**
Gold and Silver Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Flask Web Application

**üìò Project Description:**
-->This project aims to predict the next-day prices of gold and silver in the Indian market using Machine Learning techniques. The model leverages a variety of economic and market factors such as global gold/silver prices, USD/INR exchange rate, inflation indicators, repo rates, and sentiment scores.

-->The ML model is trained using historical data and deployed through a Flask-based web application, allowing users such as traders, investors, or jewelers to input current market conditions and receive real-time price predictions.

üéØ **Project Objectives:**
-Predict future gold and silver prices using regression models.

-Build an interactive web app where users can enter market values and receive predictions.

-Analyze key economic indicators affecting price fluctuations.

-Make the tool accessible for decision-making in trading and investments.
